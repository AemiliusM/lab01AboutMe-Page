                Let me tell you about myself! <br> I love to start my day by jumping on my sleeping parents heads. <br>
                After they are awake, I clean myself as I prepare for battle with my arch-nemesis. <br>
                He is my brother, Hippo. I hiss and swat at him all day no matter if he is sleeping or eating. <br>
                Once I have won the battle for the day, I clean myself again. After cleaning I will let out my battle cry "LABABALABA"
                and expel the fur of my enemy on the floor. <br> Though I clean myself daily, my parents insist upon a monthly washing. 
                No matter how I cry and fight, they ignore my pain to this torture. <br>
                They think catnip will ease my mind, but they have to sleep sometime.
